# 🧑‍💻 About Me

Meticulous, resourceful, and endlessly curious—I'm a developer who thrives on solving complex challenges at every layer of the stack. Whether it’s dissecting legacy code, architecting a new language, or building the kernel beneath it, I enjoy bridging theory with practical, scalable solutions.

# 🔧 Core Skills

- Cross-platform development with MAUI, Xamarin, and Android

- Dependency resolution, SDK-style project structures, and platform-specific configuration

- Messaging architecture (WeakReferenceMessenger, reactive patterns)

- SQLite integration and ADB troubleshooting

- CI/CD tooling, semantic release automation, and versioning strategies

# 🛠️ Current Projects

## ⚙️ Vectra

A custom programming language with its own bytecode format (.vbc), virtual machine, and compiler infrastructure. 

Repos:
- vectra-cli
- vectra-compiler
- vectra-ast
- vectra-bytecode
- vectra-vm

## 🖥️ Vectrionyx

An operating system designed to natively execute Vectra bytecode without requiring an external runtime. Kernel design in progress.

## 📦 dotnet-semantic-release

Automates semantic release flows for .NET projects by mapping conventional commits to versioning logic. Inspired by the Node.js [semantic-release](https://npmjs.com/package/semantic-release)

# 🌌 Ecosystem Vision

- A fully integrated stack where language, tooling, and OS converge:

- Native execution of .vbc files in a custom kernel environment

- Custom tooling for packaging, introspection, and reproducible builds

- Future potential: module ecosystems, dev-friendly diagnostics, secure runtime layers
